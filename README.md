Graphs driven by D3(D3.js) Data is a JavaScript library for visualizing data using web standards. D3 helps you bring data to life using SVG, Canvas and HTML. D3 combines powerful visualization and interaction techniques with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation, giving you the full capabilities of modern browsers and the freedom to design the right visual interface for your data.

## Getting Started
If you use npm, npm install d3. Otherwise, download the latest release. The released bundle supports anonymous AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments. You can load directly from d3js.org, CDNJS, or unpkg. For example:  

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js"></script>  

For the minified version:  

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>  


In Node:
var d3 = require("d3");
You can also require individual modules and combine them into a d3 object using Object.assign:
var d3 = Object.assign({}, require("d3-format"), require("d3-geo"), require("d3-geo-projection"));


### Prerequisites

Check requirements.txt file. Contains required pip install applications. 
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
