# Video Games by Sales

The project was created to compare and showcase the most successful games, consoles, and producers. The graphs are all interactive which allows the user to select their favorite producer(s), video game(s), genre and platforms. This project was greated using VS Code, Flask framework, and was styled with CSS3 and HTML5. 

Graphs driven by D3(D3.js) Data is a JavaScript library for visualizing data using web standards. D3 helps you bring data to life using SVG, Canvas and HTML. D3 combines powerful visualization and interaction techniques with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation, giving you the full capabilities of modern browsers and the freedom to design the right visual interface for your data.  



## Getting Started
If you use npm, npm install d3. Otherwise, download the latest release. The released bundle supports anonymous AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments. You can load directly from d3js.org, CDNJS, or unpkg. For example:  

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js"></script>  

For the minified version:  

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>  


In Node:
var d3 = require("d3");
You can also require individual modules and combine them into a d3 object using Object.assign:
var d3 = Object.assign({}, require("d3-format"), require("d3-geo"), require("d3-geo-projection"));




* This project was built inside VS Code using using the Flask framework.
